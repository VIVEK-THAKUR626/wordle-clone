# My attempt at making wordle
Wordle is a popular game where you have to guess a 5 letter word in 5 attempts. This is my attempt at recreating wordle. 

I downloaded a text file containing 1000 common words from **Josh Wardle's** github repo [word-lists](https://github.com/powerlanguage/word-lists). 

Then I made an Arraylist of all the 1000 words by reading the file.
To add my spin, I wrote the game in such a way where the program chooses a random word from the ArrayList of random length. The player gets the same number of chances as the word length to guess the word.

Right now, the code isn't very optimised and my still working on improving it.

*ENJOY :)*
